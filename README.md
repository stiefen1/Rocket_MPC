# Rocket_MPC
This project is part of the course Model Predictive Control given at EPFL during fall semester 2021. The objective is to control a rocket-inspired drone using MPC. The model can be seen as a flying inverted pendulum. The first controller implementation linearizes the model to use MPC. The second one is directly applying an NMPC controller to the model.
